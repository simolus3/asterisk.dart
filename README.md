# Asterisk

[Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/) is "an open-source framework for building
communications applications".
`package:asterisk` is a package for writing these communication applications in
Dart!

Asterisk allows building powerful communication systems. By providing an
abstraction over channels, bridges and endpoints and supporting a wide range of
protocols including VoIP (through SIP and RTP), it is a great choice for all
kinds of applications dealing with phone calls.
How calls are handled in Asterisk is defined in a _dialplan_, a text file which
can get complex to write and maintain in growing setups. And while Asterisk
supports a large number of builtin applications, these are sometimes hard to
setup and understand, or don't support the feature you need.

Fortunately, Asterisk contains a [RESTful interface](https://docs.asterisk.org/Configuration/Interfaces/Asterisk-REST-Interface-ARI/Getting-Started-with-ARI/),
which can be used to interact with calls. This enables you to write your own
communication apps in a language you already know.

## Features

`package:asterisk` provides high-level Dart bindings to both the Asterisk REST
interface as well as the web-socket notification mechanism for events.

Here are just some of the things you can build with this package:

- An automated voicemail system.
- [Voice-based timers](https://github.com/simolus3/asterisk.dart/blob/main/example/voice_reminder.dart).
- [Call-Roulette](https://github.com/simolus3/asterisk.dart/blob/main/example/call_roulette.dart)!
- Your very own telephone conference setup.
- A customer service system, with hold queues and everything.

Some of these have already been implemented in `examples/` - go check them
out!

However, note that this package doesn't support real-time interaction with
calls. You can record calls and play sounds, but this isn't a softphone.
Of course, you could use [Flutter WebRTC](https://flutter-webrtc.org/) to write
a voice-enabled Flutter app that can be called through an Asterisk managed
by this package.

## Getting started

Using this package requires a running Asterisk server. To interact with the
actual phone network, you need a VoIP provider that server can talk to.

### Local testing

For testing, you can emulate a local phone network, placing calls in a web
browser thanks to WebRTC.
To get started, run

```
docker run -ti --network host europe-docker.pkg.dev/simonbinder/public/asterisk_demo:latest
```

Starting asterisk will print a lot of errors as it tries to load a lot of
modules we don't need - once it prints "Asterisk Ready.", the system is ready
to go.

Visit http://localhost:8088/. When opening the website for the first time, a
settings screen will be shown.
You need to enter a SIP username under "Account" - the server will accept
`201`, `202`, `203`, `204` or `205`. They all use `demo` as their passsword and
are reachable by dialing their account number.

Next, run an example to call:

```
dart run example/main.dart
```

All examples are reachable in the demo server by dialing `1`.

## Usage

This simple Asterisk application that accepts incoming calls, announces the
caller id on the channel and then hangs up:

```dart
import 'package:asterisk/asterisk.dart';

void main() async {
  final asterisk = Asterisk(
    baseUri: Uri.parse('http://localhost:8088'),
    applicationName: 'demo',
    username: 'demoapp',
    password: 'demo',
  );
  await for (final incoming in asterisk.stasisStart) {
    _announceId(incoming.channel);
  }
}

Future<void> _announceId(LiveChannel channel) async {
  print('Has incoming call from ${channel.channel.caller}');

  await channel.answer();
  await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));

  final playback = await channel
      .play(sources: [MediaSource.digits(channel.channel.caller.number)]);
  // Wait for the playback to finish.
  await playback.events.where((e) => e is PlaybackFinished).first;

  if (!channel.isClosed) {
    await channel.hangUp();
  }
}
```
